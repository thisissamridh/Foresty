<h1>Mga Opsyonal sa Fuzzer ng Iskrin</h1>
<p>
Ang iskrin na to ay pinahihintulutan ka na isaayos ang <a href="concepts.html">pag-fuzz ng</a> mga opsyonal:

<h3>Default Category</h3>
The category that will initially be selected when the <a href="dialogue.html">Diyalogo ng Fuzz</a> magpapakita.

<h3>Add Custom Fuzz File</h3>
Allows you to add your own files to be used when fuzzing.<br>
These should be text files with one payload per line.<br>
Files are added to the 'fuzzers' directory underneath the ZAP home directory.

<h3>Finished Fuzzers in UI</h3>
It defines the numbers of fuzzers (that have completed their execution)
visible in the fuzzer tab.

<h3>Retries on IO Error</h3>
The number of retries when an input/output error occurs sending a request to the target.

<h3>Max. Errors Allowed</h3>
If the number of errors exceed this limit, fuzzer will stop its execution.

<h3>Payload Replacement Strategy</h3>
Rules defined to control the order that multiple payload lists are iterated.

<h3>Concurrent Scanning Threads per Scan</h3>
The number of threads the fuzzer will use per scan.<br>
Increasing the number of threads will speed up the scan but may put extra strain on the computer ZAP is running on as well as the target.

<h3>Delay when Fuzzing (in milliseconds)</h3>
The number of milliseconds between requests by the fuzzer to the target host, usually done to
avoid getting blocked by the target or if the target implements some sort of throttling requirement.
