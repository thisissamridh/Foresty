Adds a new "Requester" panel next to the standard "Request" and "Response" ones.
<p>
The Requester Panel acts like the Manual Request Editor but supports as many sub tabs as you need.
<p>
Right click on a request in any of the other ZAP tabs and select "Open in Requester Tab..." to open that request in a new Requester tab.
You can also use the Control / Command + "W" key to do the same thing via the keyboard.
<p>
The tabs are initially numbered but if you double click on the tab then a dialog will be shown which will allow you to rename it.
