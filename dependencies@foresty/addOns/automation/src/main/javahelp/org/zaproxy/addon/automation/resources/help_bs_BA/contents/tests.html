<H1>Automation Framework - Job Outcome Tests</H1>
The automation framework supports testing the job outcomes based on conditions that you can set in the YAML file.
Currently, tests of type 'stats' and 'alert' are available. More types will be added in the future.

<H2>Statistics</H2>
Statistics-based tests are supported by all add-ons that have an automation job. If there is a relevant
statistic used by an add-on, a test can be created for it.<br>
An up to date list of the statistics ZAP maintains can be found at 
<a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/internal-statistics/">https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/internal-statistics/</a>.
<p>
A job can have tests for multiple statistics and multiple tests can be created for the same statistic.
<p>
Note that statistics-based tests will function correctly only if in memory statistics have been 
<a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/stats/#in-memory-statistics-enabled">enabled</a>.

<H2>YAML</H2>

<pre>
  jobs:
  - type: example
    parameters:
      jobSpecificParam: 'value'
    tests:
      - name: 'test one'                      # Name of the test, optional
        type: stats                           # Specifies that the test is of type 'stats'
        statistic: 'stats.addon.something'    # Name of an integer / long statistic
        site:                                 # Name of the site for site specific tests, supports vars
        operator: '>='                        # One of '==', '!=', '&gt;=', '&gt;', '&lt;', '&lt;='
        value: 10                             # Value to compare statistic against
        onFail: 'info'                        # String: One of 'warn', 'error', 'info', mandatory

</pre>

<H2>Alert</H2>

Alert tests are supported by the activeScan and passiveScan-wait jobs. These tests can be used to validate the
presence/absence of specific alerts in the active/passive scan. It is mandatory for the alerts specified in the 
plan to have a scanRuleId, against which the generated alerts will always be matched. All other fields describing
an alert are optional regexes, and will be matched against only if they are specified.
<p>
A job can have tests for multiple alerts, and multiple tests can be created for alerts having the same scanRuleId.

<pre>
  jobs:
  - type: activeScan                   # The active scanner - this actively attacks the target so should only be used with permission
    parameters:
      context:                         # String: Name of the context to attack, default: first context
      policy:                          # String: Name of the scan policy to be used, default: Default Policy
      maxRuleDurationInMins:           # Int: The max time in minutes any individual rule will be allowed to run for, default: 0 unlimited
      maxScanDurationInMins:           # Int: The max time in minutes the active scanner will be allowed to run for, default: 0 unlimited
    tests:

        action: passIfPresent/passIfAbsent     # String: The condition (presence/absence) of the alert, default: passIfAbsent  
        scanRuleId:                            # Integer: The id of the scanRule which generates the alert, mandatory  
        alertName:                             # String: The name of the alert generated, optional
        url: http://www.example.com/path       # String: The url of the request corresponding to the alert generated, optional
        method:                                # String: The method of the request corresponding to the alert generated, optional
        attack:                                # String: The actual attack which generated the alert, optional
        param:                                 # String: The parameter which was modified to generate the alert, optional
        evidence:                              # String: The evidence corresponding to the alert generated, optional
        confidence:                            # String: The confidence of the alert, one of 'False Positive', 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Confirmed', optional
        risk:                                  # String: The risk of the alert, one of 'Informational', 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', optional
        otherInfo:                             # String: Additional information corresponding to the alert, optional
        onFail: 'info'                         # String: One of 'warn', 'error', 'info', mandatory
  
</pre>

<H2>URL Presence</H2>

Presence tests are supported by all the jobs. These tests can be used to validate the presence/absence of a URL and it's 
specific expressions in the Http response/request. The expressions are specified in the YAML file as regular expressions. 
The test will pass if the URL or the specified expression is found in the response/request depending upon the operator 
selection.
<p>
A job can have tests for multiple expressions, and multiple tests can be created for expressions having the same URL.
