This section of the YAML configuration file defines the applications which the rest of the jobs can act on.
<p>
The Automation Framework supports a subset of the <a href="authentication.html">authentication</a> mechanisms supported by ZAP.

            value:                     # The header value
      sessionManagement:
        method:                        # String, one of 'cookie', 'http', 'script'
        script:                        # String, path to script, only for 'script' session management
        scriptEngine:                  # String, the name of the script engine to use, only for 'script' session management
      users:                           # List of one or more users to use for authentication

        password:                      # String, the password to use when authenticating, vars supported
  vars:                                # List of 0 or more custom variables to be used throughout the config file
    myVarOne: CustomConfigVarOne       # Can be used as ${myVarOne} anywhere throughout the config
    myVarTwo: ${myVarOne}.VarTwo       # Can refer other vars    
  parameters:
    failOnError: true                  # If set exit on an error         
    failOnWarning: false               # If set exit on a warning
    progressToStdout: true             # If set will write job progress to stdout
</pre>

System environment variables can also be used in the config in the same manner as above. In case there are two variables
with the same name, the value of the system variable would be preferred.
